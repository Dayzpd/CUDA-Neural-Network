# CUDA Neural Nets
## Brief Explanation (and Disclaimer!)
Currently, I am implementing a framework for training neural nets in
C++ with CUDA. If for whatever reason anyone stumbles upon this, I would not
recommend that you actually use this. The primary purpose of this
is for my own educational gratification, and you would be far better off using
Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc. However, if you happen to share my interest in
learning how neural nets are implemented from scratch, feel free to look at the
code, take whatever you would like, or if you feel that it's absolute trash,
leave a comment.
